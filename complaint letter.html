<p>Subject: Complaint Regarding Food Quality</p>
<br>
<p>Respected Sir/Madam,</p>
<br>
<div class="div3">
<p>I am writing to complain about a meal we had in our canteen yesterday. We had ordered foods but we had to wait for more than 20
minutes to get it.
From a menu of 12 dishes, only few were available and their quality was poor. 
We have eaten in our cantten several times in the past but this is the first time we have received such bad treatment. I am not asking for a refund but I would like you to improve the quality of your dishes and service.
</p>
</div>
<br><br>
<p>Thanking you</p>
<br>
<div class="div4">
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<br>
<p>___(your name)</p>
